Scripts used to analyze the diffusion constants of TIP3P and water

Forcefield used: OpenFF Sage 2.1.0, "openff-2.1.0.offxml"
Charges on atoms either assigned using NAGL (default) or AM1BCC (specified using *_AM1_* in folder name
Alkanes tested: Pentane, Hexane, Heptane, Octane, Decane, Pentadecane 
Equation of motion integrator: either sd or md, *_md_* or _sd_* 
Temperature: 300k
Pressure: 1 bar



Pipeline:
1. Run buildAlkane.py, buildWater.py to create alkanes and water from smiles string, pack using openFF packmol toolkit, parameterize with interchange + use HMR
2. Run runAlkanes_equil.py to create .sh run scripts for each simulation in RC account 
    submit .sh with "for script in *equil1.sh; do sbatch "$script"; done " to run
3. Run ChangeBoxSize.py to modify box size before production run
4. Run runAlkances_prod1.py for NVT production run
    submit .sh with " for script in *_prod1.sh; do sbatch "$script"; done " 
5. Run runAlkances_prod2.py for NPT production run
    submit .sh with " for script in *_prod2.sh; do sbatch "$script"; done " 
6. Run MSD_per_particle.py for each molecule size and each moelcule. Will need to adjust for all molecules 
7. Run MSDsToDataframe.py to put data into a .pkl files
8. lookAtPkl.py to check out head of dataframe 

8. Run Bootstrapping_diffusion to get the average Ds and Sterr (computed from
