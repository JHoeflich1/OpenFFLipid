Validate diffusion parameters (coefficient, viscosity) for OpenFF Alkanes

Hexane,Heptane,Octane,Decane,Pentadecane @ 300K


Pipeline:
1. Run makeAlkanes.ipynb to create alkanes and parameterize with interchange 
2. Run packAlkanes.py to pack in Packmol and create box coordinate system
3. Run makeTopol.py to create a topology with the correct number of molecules in the box
4. Run runAlkanes_npt.py to create .sh run scripts for each simulation in RC account 
    submit .sh with " for script in *.sh; do sbatch "$script"; done " to run NPT
5. Run ChangeBoxSize.py to modify the box sizes to the total average in NPT before NVT
6. Run runAlkances_nvt.py to create .sh run scripts
    submit .sh with " for script in *nvt_1.sh; do sbatch "$script"; done " to run NVT
7. Run MSD_per_particle.py for each molecule size and each moelcule. Will need to adjust for all molecules 
8. Run Bootstrapping_diffusion to get the average Ds and Sterr (computed from bootstrapping)
8. Run Diffusion_fitting.py to calcaulte and plot the diffusion coefficients for different box sizes
9. Create folders for each moelcule and separate files into their molecules
