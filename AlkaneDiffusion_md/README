Note that the equilibration of these systems was not performed independently, 
instead I took the final nvp1_box*.gro files from AlkaneDiffusionHMR run, and started running them with modified mdps. 
Given that I only want the initial coordiantes from the equilibration runs, I think this should be okay. 
The box sizes csv file was also pulled from AlkaneDiffusionHMR to be used in future calcualtions. 

##made some files that end with *_test..
msd_test and ndx_test were created to see if using gmx msd without -pdb and -rbpbc changes the msd profile a lot
