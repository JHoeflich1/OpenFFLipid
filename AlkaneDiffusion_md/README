Note that the equilibration of these systems was not performed independently, instead I took the final nvp1_box*.gro files from AlkaneDiffusionHMR run, and started running them with modified mdps. Given that I only want the initial coordiantes from the equilibration runs, I think this should be okay. The box sizes csv file was also pulled from AlkaneDiffusionHMR to be used in future calcualtions.
