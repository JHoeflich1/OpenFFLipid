This folder holds scripts related to setting up simulations and calculating heats of vaporization

Liquid simulations have default 1000 molecules, while gas simuations have only 1 molecule

Everything run standard temperature and pressure (liquid)


Steps how this was run:

cd Output

using openff_clone env

python3 ../BuildMolecules.py

python3 ../runSims.py
