This folder holds scripts related to setting up simulations and calculating heats of vaporization

Liquid simulations have default 1000 molecules, while gas simuations have only 1 molecule

Simulations at 300K, 1 bar (liquid), vacuum (gas)

Steps how this was run:

cd Output

using openff_clone env

python3 ../BuildMolecules.py

python3 ../runSims.py
